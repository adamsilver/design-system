Any websites published since September 2018 will need to meet accessibility standards and publish an accessibility statement.

HMCTS will need to publish accessibility statements for each service, these will be available as links in the service footer.

## What the statement needs to cover

The statement must: 

 - clearly state the level of accessibility across the site or app

 - list any inaccessible parts of the website or app, and why they are not accessible

 - tell users with access needs about alternative routes, or how to request accessible versions

 - provide details on who to contact to report accessibility issues

 - explain the procedure if people are not happy with the response 


## Template


 - be published in a fully accessible form - this should be an HTML page from service footers


follow a consistent format - I am creating a template


the statement will also need to be updated annually - this should be in the sustaining team's backlog



## Background

The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 came into force on 23 September 2018. It aims to ensure public sector websites and mobile apps are accessible to all users, especially those with disabilities.

Any websites published since September 2018 will need a statement by September 2019, while older websites have until 2020 to comply.
